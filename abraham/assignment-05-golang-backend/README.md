# assignment-05-golang-backend
This is the golang backend project assignment about E-Wallet Backend API. To setup the project, create a database with the name:

wallet_db_yusuf_kristanto

After creating the database, make sure to create a .env file in the root project folder specifying the information required to run the database.

After setting up the database, run the queries inside of wallet_db_yusuf_kristanto.sql to seed the database. After seeding the database, run the API by running 

```go run main.go```

This will start the program. After that, check the documentation by going to localhost:8080/docs. There will be a full specification of the API inside of that endpoint.
